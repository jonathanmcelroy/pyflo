1. The graph provides a definition of the network
2. The network manages the components and ports

3. The ports are generators/coroutines that talk to each other.
    a. When the out generator sends informataion, the in generator calls a function defined in its component
    b. When function will return either
    
4. The components are black boxes, with internal data and functions attached to ports
    a. When the component is created, initialize all the ports
    b. When a function associated with a port is called
        1. Do operations on the data
        2. Possibly send data from other ports

When the network starts, it will send the first initial data to the first port.
    The port will send the data to a function defines in the component.
        The function will perform operations on the data
        The function may send data through other ports
        

class network:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        create node
        connect edges
        
        create scheduler
        add inital data to scheduler
        
    def run(self):
        call scheduler.mainloop()
        
    def send_data(self, node, port, data):
        yield node.port.send(data)
